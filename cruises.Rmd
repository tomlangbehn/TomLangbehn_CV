# Research Cruises

I have participated in 9 research cruises, including one as a cruise leader, and spent in total > 50 days at sea, with some cruises lasting up to two weeks. I have worked both on research and commercial fishing vessels, in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, Icelandic waters, Norwegian coastal waters, the Barents Sea and Arctic waters up to the marginal ice zone.
