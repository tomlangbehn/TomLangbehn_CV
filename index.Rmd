aboutme: |
   I am a marine biologist with a keen interested in evolutionary ecology and global change biology, i.e., how climate change and human activities such as fisheries shape biological interactions and processes across various levels of organisation. I aim to solve real-life problems by identifying and understanding how processes at the individual level drive ecosystems. In my work, I combine mechanistic modelling often informed by theory with observation from the field. I enjoy thinking broadly and across disciplines and have a particular fascination for polar ecosystems and the ocean twilight zone.
